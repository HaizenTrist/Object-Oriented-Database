# Transferring a List of Students into a Database

Converted a text-based list of students into a database using C++, allowing for easy searching, insertion, and deletion of student data by desired criteria.

Automatically copied and sorted data from the old list without need for manual entry and mitigated possibility of errors by adding functions to report entries with invalid data.

Below is the example student information used:

| Student ID | First Name      | Last Name      | Email                    | Age      | Days in Course                       | Degree Program |
